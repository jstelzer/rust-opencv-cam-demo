Then spent a while figuring out what env vars to set.

Then spent a while figuring out why the cargo build kept failing.

Read the docs closer on the https://lib.rs/crates/opencv page and landed on what's in Cargo.toml now.

This generates a binary, but if you look at it with otool you'll see it's linked to a ton of stuff in /usr/local.
This means it's not trivial to redistribute. Which is fine for me, because this is a toy.

But, if you every wanted to redistribute it you'll have some work to do to pull in all the deps and set DYLD_* 
vars at runtime. Or however vendoring third party libs works on macos when grownups do it.

To compile this source in the env.sh then do a cargo build.

You shouldn't need to set any ENV vars at runtime.

This whole mess liks to stuff in /usr/local by default. So it's more like a unix application than a macos one.

I don't know enough about native mac apps to bundle it up, but it's on my list of things to learn at some point.
